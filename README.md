# FruitPunch AI Code epoch 5: Implementing the random forest algorithm

AI Code is an initiative by fruitpunch where students can learn to apply AI together by solving a challenge under supervision of an expert. This repository contains the challenge files for epoch 5.

# Challenge description

After two applied challenges, we step back a little for a fundamental challenge.
Implement one of the most popular machine learning algorithms: Random forest. This will improve your understanding of machine learning.
